# Secret Resource Manager
## Description
This application provides access to secret resources. It uses the [microservice architecture](http://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html).
1) The application authenticates a user by checking their username and password.
1) Then it checks whether the user is authorized to access the secret resource.
1) After a user is found to be authentic and authorized to access the resource, the application returns the resource string

We use three microservices in this application:
  - authentication service
  - authorization service
  - resource service

### [Authentication service](https://github.com/saurabhagrawal0412/Assignment1/tree/master/authentication-service)
This service takes user id, password and resource id as input. This service stores the user ids and passwords in a MySQL database. It queries the database to authenticate the user. If the user is **legit**, it calls Authorization service for checking authorization of the user to access the resource. Otherwise, it returns a [401](https://httpstatuses.com/401).
This service is written in Python and exposes REST endpoints using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).

### [Authorization service](https://github.com/saurabhagrawal0412/Assignment1/tree/master/authorization-service)
This service takes user id and resource id as input. This service stores the authorizations of users in a MySQL database. It queries the database to check whether a user is authorized to access a specific resource. If the user is **authorized**, it calls Resource service to get the secret resource string. Otherwise, it returns a [401](https://httpstatuses.com/401).
This service is written in Javascript and uses [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/) to expose REST endpoints.

### [Resource service](https://github.com/saurabhagrawal0412/Assignment1/tree/master/resource-service)
This service takes resource id as input. This service stores the resource ids and the secret resource strings in a MySQL database. It queries the database to retrieve the resource string with respect to a resource id. If the resource id is **valid**, it returns the secret resource string. Otherwise, it returns a [400](https://httpstatuses.com/400).
This service is written in Java and uses [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) to expose the REST endpoints.
